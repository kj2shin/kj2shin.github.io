# Problem
In this post, we wish to calculate $$x^y$$. This seems like a pretty simple problem to solve! Let's formulate the problem first:

> We want function `power(x, y)` that accepts two integer inputs `x` and `y` returns $$x^y$$.

By definition, $$x^y$$ is described as the following:

```
if y is positive:
    power(x,y) == x * x * ... * x
    (where there are y number of x's)

    ex. power(2, 3) == 2 * 2 * 2 == 8

if y is 0:
    power(x,y) == 1

    ex. power(1000, 0) == 1

if y is negative:
    power(x,y) == 1/x * 1/x * ... * 1/x
    (where there are y number of (1/x)'s)

    ex. power(2, -3) == (1/2) * (1/2) * (1/2)
                     == (1/8)
                     == 1/(power(2, 3))
```

# Solution
Let's assume that there is no overflow and underflow.

## Brute-force Approach
Let's start with considering `y >= 0` case only, the simplest approach is multiplying `x` by itself `y-1` times.

```python
def power(x,y):
    result = 1.0
    for i in range(y):
        result *= x
    return result
```

The time complexity of such algorithm is `O(y)` since we perform `y-1` multiplications. Hence, the algorithm will get slower as we increase the value of `y`.


## Recursive Approach
The above solution will perform well for small value of `y`. However, the run time will grow linearly with the size of `y`. The key idea to improve this algorithm is to **reduce the number of multiplication required**.

### Exponential Properties
Here are some exponential properties that we will use in this post.
- Power to power: \$$(a^m)^n = a^{mn}$$
- Product of like bases: \$$a^ma^n = a^{m+n}$$

---

Let's consider the following problem: $$1.1^{20}$$.
Using out brute-force algorithm, we would need to perform 19 multiplcations. However, using the exponential property, we can breakdown the problem like this, $(1.1^{10})^2$, then we only need to calcualte $$9 + 1 = 10$$ calculations only! By expanding this further, we can reduce the multiplication down to 5.

$$
(1.1^{10})^2 = (((1.1^5))^2)^2 = ((1.1 * (1.1^2)^2)^2)^2
$$

So what is the pattern here? **Recursion**! The pattern here looks like the following:
$$
pow(a, n) =
    \begin{cases}
        1,                  & \text{$n = 0$} \\
        pow(a, n/2)^2,      & \text{if $n$ is even}\\
        pow(a, n/2)^2 * a,  & \text{if $n$ is odd}
    \end{cases}
$$

Not let's code this:
```python
def power(x,y):
    if y == 0:
        return 1
    temp = power(x, int(y/2))
    if y % 2 == 0:
        return temp * temp
    else:
        return x * temp * temp
```
Notice that we are using `temp` variable to not perform `power(x, int(y/2))` twice. The run time of this is `O(log(y))` as we are dividing `y` into its half at every iteration.

To support negative `y`, we can modify it like the following:
```python
def power(x,y):
    if y < 0:
        x, y = 1.0 / x, -y
    if y == 0:
        return 1
    temp = power(x, int(y/2))
    if y % 2 == 0:
        return temp * temp
    else:
        return x * temp * temp
```

## Binary Expression Approach
This is the solution provided by <quote>Elements of Programming Interviews</quote> book. I will write down the solution here first.

```python
def power(x, y):
    result, pow = 1.0, y
    if y < 0:
        pow, x = -pow, 1.0 / x
    while pow:
        if pow & 1:
            result *= x;
        x, pow = x * x, pow >> 1
    return result
```
The idea behind is same as recursive approach; however it utilizes binary representation of `y` and _product of like bases_ exponential property. Let's consider the following expresions:
<br>
$$
x^{10} = x^{(1010)_2} 
       = x^{(101)_2 + (101)_2}
       = x^{(101)_2} * x^{(101)_2}
       = x^5 * x^5
$$

<br>
$$
x^{5} = x^{(101)_2} 
      = x^{(100)_2 + (1)_2}
      = x^{(100)_2} * x^{(1)_2}
      = x^{(10)_2} * x^{(10)_2} * x^{(1)_2}
      = x^2 * x^2 * x
$$

So to generalize, if the LSB of y is `0` (== even), the result is $$(x^{y/2})^2$$; otherwise, $$x * (x^{y/2})^2$$


# Conclusion
By using mathematical property, we were able to reduce the time complexity through recusive approach!
