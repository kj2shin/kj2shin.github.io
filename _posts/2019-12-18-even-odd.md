# Problem Description
Write a function that takes an array of integers and returns reordered array such that the even entries appear first. Solve it without allocating additional storage.

# Example
```
input: [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8]
output: [2,4,6,8,1,3,5,7] or [8,2,4,6,1,7,5,3]
```

# Algorithm
**Key Idea**: take advantage of the fact that with arrays, you can operate efficiently on both ends
- Partition the array into three subarrays: Even, Unclassified, and Odd (appearing in this order)
- Initially Even and Odd are empty and Unclassified is the entire array
- Iterate through Unclassified while moving its elements to the boundaries of the Even and Odd subarrays via swap. Thereby, the Unclassified gets shrinked and the Even and Odd expand.

# Code
```python
def even_odd(A):
    next_even, next_odd = 0, len(A)-1
    while next_even < next_odd:
        if A[next_even] % 2 == 0:
            next_even += 1
        else:
            A[next_even], A[next_odd] = A[next_odd], A[next_even]
            next_odd += 1
```

# Test Cases
```python
A = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9]
even_odd(A)
print(A)
# [8, 2, 6, 4, 5, 7, 3, 9, 1]
```

# Analysis
We do a constant amount of processing per entry, so the time complexity is `O(n)`.
The additional space complexity is `O(1)`.
